# listtools

Tools for manipulating lists of things, and in particular, taxonomic
checklists and hierarchies.

This tool suite is intended to eventually replace the ['checklist
diff'](https://github.com/jar398/cldiff) tool.  Although most
list comparison functionality is in place, the logic for comparing
hierarchies is still being debugged.
