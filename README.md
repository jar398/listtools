### History

THE GENESIS FOR THIS SOFTWARE WAS A CONVERSATION AROUND 2018 OR 2019
WITH NICO FRANZ, WHO SUGGESTED THAT A GENERIC TOOL FOR COMPARING
CHECKLISTS MIGHT BE WIDELY USEFUL.  BEFORE THIS CONVERSATION I HAD
BEEN WORKING ON
[SMASHER](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/OPENTREEOFLIFE/REFERENCE-TAXONOMY/) (SEE
[ARTICLE](HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.3897/BDJ.5.E12581)), WHICH DID SOMETHING
SIMILAR, AND I FELT A DESIRE TO REWRITE IT ON A FIRMER THEORETICAL AND
NOMENCLATURAL FOUNDATION TO MAKE IT MORE "SOUND", AND TO CREATE A
FREE-STANDING TOOL INDEPENDENT OF THE OPEN TREE OF LIFE PROJECT OR ANY
OTHER FRAMEWORK.

THIS TOOL SUITE REPLACES THE OLDER ['CHECKLIST
DIFF'](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/JAR398/CLDIFF) TOOL.

### Reproducibility note

As of 2026 an article on listtools is in preparation.  See 
[reproducibility notes](doc/colmdd.sh).
