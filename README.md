# listtools

Tools for manipulating lists of things, and in particular, taxonomic
checklists and hierarchies.

* [Installation](doc/guide.md#installation)
* [User guide](doc/guide.md)

This tool suite is intended to eventually replace the ['checklist
diff'](https://github.com/jar398/cldiff) tool.  Although most
list comparison functionality is in place, the logic for comparing
hierarchies is still being debugged.

The genesis for this software was a conversation with Nico Franz, who
suggested that something like this might be generally useful.  Before
that I was working on
[smasher](https://github.com/opentreeoflife/reference-taxonomy/) (see
[article](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e12581)), which did something
similar, and I felt a desire to rewrite it on a firmer theoretical
foundation to make it "more correct" and to make it independent of the
Open Tree of Life project.
