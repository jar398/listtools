The genesis for this software was a conversation around 2019 or 2020
with Nico Franz, who suggested that a generic tool for comparing
checklists might be widely useful.  Before this conversation I had been working on
[smasher](https://github.com/opentreeoflife/reference-taxonomy/) (see
[article](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e12581)), which did something
similar, and I felt a desire to rewrite it on a firmer theoretical
foundation to make it "more sounds" and to make create a free-standing
tool independent of the Open Tree of Life project or any other framework.

This tool suite is intended to eventually replace the older ['checklist
diff'](https://github.com/jar398/cldiff) tool.
