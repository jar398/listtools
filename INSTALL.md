## Installation

The tools require no particular installation step.  They can be
invoked from the shell out of a clone of this `git` repository.

Python 3 is assumed.

Install the python3 `regex` module using `pip3` or equivalent.

Also required is `gnparser`, which has download instructions
[here](https://github.com/gnames/gnparser#installation).  I have
minimally tested listtools against version 1.11.8 (July 2025).

If you are working with MDD (the Mammal Diversity Database), you may
want to get version 2 or beyond of the MDD-DwC-mapping tool, located
as of January 2026 in the 'MDD-DwC-mapping' repository, user jar398,
at github.com.
